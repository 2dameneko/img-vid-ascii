**üíæ Ultra-Compact .ascii Format**  
Share creations that are **10‚Äì100√ó smaller** than originals! A 50MB video becomes a 1.5MB `.ascii` file ‚Äî perfect for messaging and storage.

**üîä Perfect Audio Preservation**  
Enjoy videos with **original, untouched audio quality**. Soundtracks remain crystal clear and perfectly synced.

**‚è© Lightning-Fast Processing**  
Experience **3‚Äì5√ó realtime conversion speeds**. GPU acceleration makes reconstruction back to MP4 blazing fast.
